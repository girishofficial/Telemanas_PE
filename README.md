#  Telemans analysis with Llama‑Powered SQL‑to‑Graph Demo
This repository demonstrates converting **CSV to SQLite**, running a **Flask/Streamlit** server, and interacting with a **2B‑parameter LLaMA model** to convert **Natural Language → SQL → Graphs**.

##  Quick Setup Instructions

###  [Google Drive Link for Data & Resources]()

---

###  1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # for macOS/Linux
```

###  2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>  If you get an error for packages like `json`, `typing`, `logging`, etc. — they are part of Python’s standard library. You do **not** need to list or install them separately.

###  3. Run LLaMA-based Server

> The model used is around **2B parameters**, requiring approximately **8 GB RAM**.

* If you **have 8 GB RAM or more**, you're good to go!
* If **not**, then open `server.py` and **comment out** the last line:

```python
# t1.start()
```

###  4. Start the Server
#### This to be done everyday once to include the updated database information at the front end. Front end need not to be uploaded again and again.

```bash
python server.py
```

Your server will now be live at `http://localhost:8000`

##  Convert CSV to SQLite

First step is to convert your input CSV file into a SQLite database.

```bash
python nl_to_sql_to_graph/csv_to_sqlite.py
```

This generates `database.sqlite` in the root folder.

---

##  Tips to Improve Results

###  Prompt Engineering

* Provide **multiple variations** of your natural language prompts.

###  Fine‑Tuning

* Fine‑tune the LLM with **diverse SQL queries**.

###  Use More Powerful LLMs

* You can swap in a stronger LLaMA variant or a completely different model via the loader logic in `server.py`.
